# Encryption-Project

This Python project implements encryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to securely protect sensitive text data. It includes a simple, unified interface for encrypting and decrypting text, along with key management features for generating encryption keys. The project demonstrates key concepts of cryptography, including symmetric encryption, key generation, and data security. It is built using the pycryptodome library, providing a secure method for handling text encryption and decryption in Python.
